                    <h3>Web Uses</h3>
                    <p>With the popularization of the World Wide Web, windows were adapted for use in the many web browsers that evolved in parallel with the dot com boom. The containment function of windows is shared by many elements of the box-model that governs web layouts. Elements can be styled to contain their contents differently, either hiding contents beyond their boundaries, allowing scrolling within the container, or simply letting the contents overflow. Windows on the web often take a common form known as the modal, a subordinate window that renders its parent window inactive in order to redirect user focus to itself. This can be used for important messages such as alerts, warnings, and confirmation dialogs, or for content that must be hierarchically distinguished from the main document (e.g. image lightboxes, login forms).</p>
                    <h3>Abuses &amp; Criticisms</h3>
                    <p>As the early internet began to fluorish, corporations and advertisers explored a wide variety of monetization schemes, attempting to identify the models best suited to an unprecedented interactive medium. Windows and modals were abused as a mechanism for redirecting a user's attention, often interrupting the flow of browsing. These most commonly took the form of popup ads with vibrant graphics and click-bait messaging. As a result of abuses and the ultimately harmful effect of windows on a user's browsing experience, the use of modals and windows has been largely scaled back as an acceptable user interface design practice, carefully reserved for warranted uses.</p>

                    <h3>Window Management</h3>
                    <p>From its name it’s easy to tell that a GUI window most obviously models a window in the physical world in that its boundaries determine the visible portion of the information that lies beyond its surface. The other physical objects and experiences that windows model become clearer in the context of how users may manipulate them. In 1987, Windows 2.0x improved window management capabilities; users could now move windows (with overlapping), hide, restore, close, and resize them.</p>
                    <h3>Metaphors</h3>
                    <p>It is in all of the above actions except resizing that a window more closely models a sheet of paper; it is arranged and can be moved on a flat desktop and may be stacked on top of other sheets; it can be hidden or shelved temporarily and restored to the desktop at a later time; it can be removed from the desktop surface completely (contrast this with a physical window which still occupies wall space in its closed state). The resizing action resembles physical interaction with an analog cropping tool; changing the vertical or physical dimensions of a window determines what is viewable within its boundaries.</p>

                    <p>The most successful model for GUIs was the WIMP paradigm, developed by Xerox at the Palo Alto Research Center and popularized in 1984 by Apple’s Macintosh computers. WIMP stands for “windows, icons, menus, pointers,” which are the four core graphical metaphors that facilitate interactions in this type of system. This model was successful due to its ability to virtually abstract workspaces at a time when computers were mainly used for work-oriented purposes.</p>

                <p>Before the innovation of the GUI, the I/O mechanism for computers was the command line interface (CLI).</p>
                <p>All input to the computer took the form of discrete text-based commands; output was also text-based.</p>
                <p>The graphical user interface (GUI) allowed the user to input instructions by manipulating graphical representations of information, with the resulting output reflected as changes to these onscreen elements.</p>
                <p>This approach represented a groundbreaking paradigm in the field that was psychologically successful because it virtually modeled the way that humans manipulate the objects that they interact with in the physical world.</p>

                    <p>A window is a graphical instance of  an application. Its main function is to visually contain the display output of the process to which it belongs. It is in this way that windows visually distinguish processes from one another. By displaying output, windows can also provide opportunities for input to users. In most cases, windows may be moved, resized, hidden, restored, and closed.</p>
